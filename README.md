# 📝 Sales Performance Report: Understanding Customers for Profit Growth

# 🌟 Project Overview
This project aims to help businesses understand their customers better and plan strategies for increasing sales in the next year. By analyzing past sales data, we can make informed decisions to target the right customers at the right time and through the best sales channels.

# Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a comprehensive report on annual sales that helps businesses:
Understand who their customers are (age, gender, location).
Learn which products and channels perform best.
Make strategic plans to increase sales and profits next year.

# Data Preparation:
Cleaned Data: Standardized gender entries (e.g., "M" or "Man" became "Man") and made values more readable (e.g., clearer product names).
Created Age Groups: Grouped customers by age to analyze their buying patterns.
Extracted Date Info: Pulled out the month from the date column for monthly comparisons.

# Data Analysis
Once the data was clean, I analyzed it to find meaningful insights that can guide decision-making. Here’s what I explored:

#### 🔸Monthly Sales and Orders:
Compared sales and orders by month to identify which months had the highest sales.

#### 🔹Man vs Woman:
Compared sales between men and women to see who contributes more to total sales.

#### 🔸Order Status:
Analyzed the status of orders (delivered, canceled, etc.) to understand trends in fulfillment.

#### 🔹Top 5 States:
Found which states contribute the most to sales.

#### 🔸Sales by Age Group & Gender:
Looked at the relationship between age groups and gender to see who buys the most.

#### 🔹Sales by Category:
Analyzed product categories to see which ones are most popular among customers.

#### 🔸Sales by Channel:
Checked sales performance across different shopping platforms (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra).
