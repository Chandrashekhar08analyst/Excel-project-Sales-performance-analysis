# ðŸ“Š Annual Sales Report: Understanding Customers for Profit Growth

Project Overview
This project aims to help businesses understand their customers better and plan strategies for increasing sales in the next year. By analyzing past sales data, we can make informed decisions to target the right customers at the right time and through the best sales channels.

Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a comprehensive report on annual sales that helps businesses:

Understand their customer base.
Improve sales strategies for the upcoming year.
Make better decisions based on data insights.
Data Preparation
Before diving into analysis, I cleaned and prepared the data to make sure it's accurate and easy to understand:

Fixed Names: I standardized the names for gender (e.g., "M" or "Man" became "Man"; "W" or "Woman" became "Woman").
Readable Values: Made certain columns easier to read, such as improving product names.
Extracted Useful Info: Pulled out the month from the date column for monthly analysis.
Created Age Groups: Grouped customers into different age categories to better understand buying patterns (e.g., Teen, Adult, Senior).
Data Analysis
Once the data was clean, I analyzed it to find meaningful insights that can guide decision-making. Hereâ€™s what I explored:

Monthly Sales and Orders:

Compared sales and orders by month to identify which months had the highest sales.
Man vs Woman:

Compared sales between men and women to see who contributes more to total sales.
Order Status:

Analyzed the status of orders (delivered, canceled, etc.) to understand trends in fulfillment.
Top 5 States:

Found which states contribute the most to sales.
Sales by Age Group & Gender:

Looked at the relationship between age groups and gender to see who buys the most.
Sales by Category:

Analyzed product categories to see which ones are most popular among customers.
Sales by Channel:

Checked sales performance across different shopping platforms (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra).
Key Insights
After analyzing the data, here are some important findings:

Women Buy More Than Men:

Women contribute about 65% of total sales, showing that they are more likely to shop compared to men.
Top 3 States:

Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the states with the highest sales.
Most Active Age Group:

The adult age group (30-49 years old) is responsible for 50% of the total sales.
Best Sales Channels:

Online platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra are the top three contributors to sales.
Conclusion
Based on these insights, hereâ€™s how businesses can improve sales in malls:

Focus on Women:
Target female customers since they are more likely to make purchases.

Age Group Focus:
Prioritize customers aged 30-49 as they are the biggest contributors to sales.

Location Targeting:
Concentrate marketing efforts in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, as these states have the highest number of customers.

Online Integration:
Partner with popular online platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra to offer discounts, coupons, and special promotions to boost sales.

Final Recommendation
To increase mall sales, businesses should target women aged 30-49 living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by using ads and offering special coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
